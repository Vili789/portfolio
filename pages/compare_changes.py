    üîç **Compare Changes Over Time**  

    This tool allows you to **track changes in your Instagram followers and following lists** over time.  
    If you have saved **older Instagram ZIP files**, you can upload them here along with a **newer ZIP file** to:
    
    - üÜï Identify **new followers** you've gained.
    - üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Find out **who unfollowed you**.
    - ‚ûï See **who you started following**.
    - ‚ûñ Check **who you unfollowed**.

    ---
    
    ‚ö† **Important:**  
    - This **only works if you have previously saved ZIP files** from past downloads.  
    - I **highly recommend** creating a **dedicated folder on your computer** to store all your Instagram ZIP files **whenever you download them**.  
    - **Do NOT unzip the files**‚Äîupload them as they are.  

    ---
    
    üìù **P.S.**  
    If you download **both the old and new files on the same day**, Instagram will **timestamp them with the download date, not the request date**.  
    This means you might not see accurate comparisons if you download multiple files in one session. You could, however, manually change the name of the file to reflect the actual day of data retrieval, in which case this would not be an issue. Nevertheless, it is still recommended to keep your older files as Instagram only allows downloading them for 7 days after requesting them.
